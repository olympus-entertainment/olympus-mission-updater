# Olympus Mission Updater
## Why?
Downloading mission files through this updater is magnitudes faster than downloading through Arma 3 and has the benefit of not adding extra load to the server's constrained network.

## Running
#### [1] Compiled .exe
The easiest way to run the updater is to download the latest compiled version [here](https://github.com/olympus-entertainment/olympus-mission-updater/releases/latest/download/Olympus.Mission.Updater.exe).

When running the application, you will likely have to ignore the SmartScreen warning by clicking "more info" then "Run anyway".

If you do not trust that the .exe matches the source code, you can run the .ahk manually.

#### [2] Running the ahk manually
1. Install [Auto Hotkey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ahk-v2.exe)
2. Download the latest version as .zip [here](https://github.com/olympus-entertainment/olympus-mission-updater/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
3. Extract the zip to a folder
4. Run "Olympus Mission Updater.ahk" with AutoHotkey


## Using
1. Open the application
2. Select which mission files you'd like to download
3. Click "Download"
4. The mission files will be downloaded to your MPMissionsCache (%LocalAppData%\Arma 3\MPMissionsCache)

Note: it does not matter if you are in game when you use the updater.
